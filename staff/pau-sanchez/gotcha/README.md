# REACT EXPRESS NODE MONGO-DB APP, GOTCHA! (http://gotcha.surge.sh)

### FINAL PROJECT DEVELOPED AT SKYLAB CODERS

## Functional description

### Gotcha, is a web app built to take notes while watching Youtube videos.

## How it works

Once selected the video you are interested to take notes from, copy the youtube URL and choose a name for the notebook where the notes will be stored.

In the main page, add the title, paste the youtube URL and press submit.

The user will be redirected to the 'editors area'

Press, play to the Youtube video.

Once a moment wants to be captured, press the red button (Gotcha!)

A form, will be displayed, where a title (required) and text for the note can be added.

Then press submit and the note will be automatically stored.

To come back to the moment, just press the Play icon and automatically the video will return to this moment.

All the stored Notebooks and Notes will be available to in the 'Notebooks' and 'Notes' sections. From those sections, once selected (play icon), Notebooks and Notes can be shared, just by passing the URL. However, store, edit or delete (notes and notebooks) can only be performed by the creator.
